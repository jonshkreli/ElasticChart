# ElasticChart
My first js chart. It is actually used to show currency rates. It is fetching data from http://rates.fxcm.com/RatesXML
It is based on p5.js

It is called elastic becaouse in the future it will have a lot of intelligent and elastic managment and visualisation of given data.

This chart can show multiple data in the same chart. right now it support only plot and line chart. It use ajax call to update date which is handled by server.php so in order to activate that you need a php server like apache.
